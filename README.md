# clickygame

The application should render different Pokemon images to the screen. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time and reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
